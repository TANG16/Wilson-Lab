- Image enhancement by triangular convolution (See confocal microscopy papers)
- Make each new ROI appear with a new color
- thicken ROI lines for better figures (and add thicker background)
- Build up database of ROIs for PCA
- Biexponential fit all pixels of an image, make a time constant image
- Custom initial guesses in the multiexponential fit
- Show percent contribution of each principal component
- Assign different color to pos. and neg. for each principal component
- Principal component histogram and entropy measure
- Pump-probe instrument response deconvolution
- Combine linear projection GUI with PCA GUI (so PCs can be used as a basis for linear projection)
- Display a cross-section in z stack viewer
- Low-pass filtering of pump-probe signals.
- Illumination correction (fit B-spline surface, then divide)
- reflectance artifact rejection
- scale z stacks by index of refraction for more accurate depth measurements
- Export stacks to a sequence of powerpoint slides
- When multiple channels are open from the same stack, synchronize these windows.
- 4D stack viewer (x, y, z, t), and PCA for the entire z-t stack
